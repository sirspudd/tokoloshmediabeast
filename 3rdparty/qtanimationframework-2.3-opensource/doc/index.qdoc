    	\section1 Description
	
            This component adds a convenient API to do animations in Qt.
            Note that this solution is experimental and work in progress:
            No backwards compatibility (source nor binary) is provided.
        

	
    The Animation Framework lets you define, run and control animations,
    states and transitions. The foundation classes QtPropertyAnimation,
    QtSequentialAnimationGroup and QtParallelAnimationGroupare used to
    scoreboard both simple and complex animations.
    A simple animation might change a widget's geometry from one rectangle
    to another, over the course of 2 seconds, using a linear easing curve.
    You can daisy-chain animations by adding them to a QtSequentialAnimationGroup,
    a class that also gives you fine grained control over pauses and combinations
    of parallel and sequential subanimations.
    In addition to this, The State Machine Framework lets you define and run
    state machines.
