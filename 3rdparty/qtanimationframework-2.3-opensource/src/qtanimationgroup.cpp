    \class QtAnimationGroup
    \brief The QtAnimationGroup is an abstract base class for group of animations.
    
    
    \preliminary

    QtAnimationGroup represents a group of animations, such as parallel or sequential,
    and lets you combine different animations into one. The group manages any animation
    that inherits QtAbstractAnimation. By combining groups, you can easily construct
    complex animation graphs.

    The QtAnimationGroup base class provides methods for adding and retrieving animations.
    Besides that, you can remove animations by calling remove(), and clear the animation
    group by calling clearAnimations(). You may keep track of changes in the group's animations by
    listening to QEvent::ChildAdded and QEvent::ChildRemoved events.

    QtAnimationGroup takes ownership of the animations it manages, and ensures that they are
    deleted when the animation group is deleted.
