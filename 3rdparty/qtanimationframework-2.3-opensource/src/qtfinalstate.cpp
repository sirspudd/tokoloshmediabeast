  \class QtFinalState

  \brief The QtFinalState class provides a final state.

  
  

  A final state is used to communicate that (part of) a QtStateMachine has
  finished its work. When a final top-level state is entered, the state
  machine's \l{QtStateMachine::finished()}{finished}() signal is emitted. In
  general, when a final substate (a child of a QtState) is entered, a
  QtStateFinishedEvent is generated for the final state's parent
  state. QtFinalState is part of \l{The State Machine Framework}.

  To use a final state, you create a QtFinalState object and add a transition
  to it from another state. Example:

  \code
  QPushButton button;

  QtStateMachine machine;
  QtState *s1 = new QtState();
  QtFinalState *s2 = new QtFinalState();
  s1->addTransition(&button, SIGNAL(clicked()), s2);
  machine.addState(s1);
  machine.addState(s2);

  QObject::connect(&machine, SIGNAL(finished()), QApplication::instance(), SLOT(quit()));
  machine.setInitialState(s1);
  machine.start();
  \endcode
