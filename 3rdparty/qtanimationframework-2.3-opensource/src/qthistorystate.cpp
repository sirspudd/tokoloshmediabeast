  \class QtHistoryState

  \brief The QtHistoryState class provides a means of returning to a previously active substate.

  
  

  A history state is a pseudo-state that represents the child state that the
  parent state was in the last time the parent state was exited. A transition
  with a history state as its target is in fact a transition to one of the
  other child states of the parent state. QtHistoryState is part of \l{The
  State Machine Framework}.

  Use QtState::addHistoryState() to construct a history state. Use the
  setDefaultState() function to set the state that should be entered if the
  parent state has never been entered.  Example:

  \code
  QtStateMachine machine;

  QtState *s1 = new QtState();
  QtState *s11 = new QtState(s1);
  QtState *s12 = new QtState(s1);

  QtState *s1h = s1->addHistoryState();
  s1h->setDefaultState(s11);

  machine.addState(s1);

  QtState *s2 = new QtState();
  machine.addState(s2);

  QPushButton *button = new QPushButton();
  // Clicking the button will cause the state machine to enter the child state
  // that s1 was in the last time s1 was exited, or the history state's default
  // state if s1 has never been entered.
  s1->addTransition(button, SIGNAL(clicked()), s1h);
  \endcode
