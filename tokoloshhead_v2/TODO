- GUI for shortcuts, using Config for it now which should continue to work as a backend
- Volume slider
- Title bar
- Cool filedialog for loading skins (previews, disable non-working skins etc)
- Text stuff
- Update song position to slider/tokolosh/display
- Fix repeat shuffle positions
- Playlist editor
- Whatever playpaus does
- Eq
- Refactor some stuff so I do as little as possible in setSkin
- Implement double-size stuff (scaling) (graphicsview?)
- Load songs passed on command line
- m3u handling
- Consider rewriting config to have a static QSettings member. Would be nicer and faster
- Make filedialog show border and not main gui. Will that work? Separate process?
- Verbose mode that dumps all sorts of stuff
