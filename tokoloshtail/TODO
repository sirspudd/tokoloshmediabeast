- Make it store playlist in an m3u. Temporary one unless told to store somewhere?

- Make tail run as a daemon (using QtService?)
- Should the backend be threaded? Could there be a multi-user
  situation? What about heavy recursing directory stuff?
  Maybe all playlist stuff in separate thread? or xine-stuff in
  separate thread?
